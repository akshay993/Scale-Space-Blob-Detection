# Scale-Space-Blob-Detection

Implemented in MATLAB

The Project is done for the Computer Vision and Image Processing class CSE573 and all the necessary instructions are included in the instructions pdf file.

This is an implementation of a Laplacian Blob Detector.

Following things have been implmented for creating the above:

1. Generated a Laplacian of Gaussian filter
2. Built a Laplacian scale space
3. Performed nonmaximum suppression in scale space
4. Displayed the resulting circles at their characteristic scales

Implementation code is in the MATLAB folder.
